# mnist_digit_classification
Through this short project, we investigate how the MNIST dataset digits can be transformed into low-dimensional objects using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
We compute both KMeans and Spectral Clustering to address whether the compressed data forms 10 distinct clusters or not.
Finally, we look at the performances of KNN on the compressed data
